## Why PRO?

Inlets PRO is a commercial-grade Cloud Native Tunnel which is secure by default through automatic TLS (encryption).

* Tunnel through NAT and firewalls transparently
* Work with any TCP traffic - including databases, TLS, SSH, Kubernetes IngressControllers and custom APIs
* You can run in any region where you have access to a server, unlike SaaS products
* You are in complete control of the tunnel at both ends
* You can either expose a TCP service on the internet, or only to a remote local network 
* We have spent weeks building deep integrations into Kubernetes
* You're gaining months worth of work to integrate directly to different cloud vendors and IaaS platforms, if you should need it such as: EC2, Azure, Packet, Scaleway, DigitalOcean and Civo
* Multi-arch support is built-in for Windows, Linux and MacOS whether on Intel or ARM
* Convenient static binaries are supplied which require no other dependencies
* Free systemd unit files and Kubernetes YAML files
* Free access to dozens of tutorials and complementary OSS projects

Non-commercial users can enjoy free community support, and commercial users can rest assured that they have someone to talk to if things are not going to plan.

We also provide commercial support and can design a custom reference architecture for you whether using Kubernetes or not.

Why do I need to purchase a fixed-term?

inlets-pro is designed for automated use within a commercial-context, and as such does not include "call-home" functionality to a license server. The license is validated by JWT and must be purchased ahead of time, several durations are made available.

> Note: the first 30 orders can use discount code `teamserverless-earlybird` for money off.
