Why do I need to purchase a fixed-term?

inlets-pro is designed for automated use within a commercial-context, and as such does not include "call-home" functionality to a license server. The license is validated by JWT and must be purchased ahead of time, several durations are made available.

> Note: the first 30 orders can use discount code `teamserverless-earlybird` for money off.
